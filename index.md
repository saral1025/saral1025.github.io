### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
    Lab 6 Guessing Game was one of the first games I created with C++. The guessing game allowed me to make a secret number, take in a number, and also compare them. It is also one of the first games that allowed me to interact with the user/player.

* Lab 9
    Lab 9 Spell Checker showed a glimpse of what happens behind the scene whenever I use Word or Google Docs. We compared string to another string and I realized that each spelling checker would probably use similar logic with extra graphics and options. It was also a good practice to open a file and read a file.

* Lab 10
    Lab 10 was exciting and fun to accomplish because it was a visual output. We were able to change and increase each color of the RGB for each row or column of pixels. After completing this lab, I am now more interested in computer graphics and I want to explore more in the field.
